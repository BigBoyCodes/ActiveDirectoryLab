<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this lab, I successfully set up a fully functional Active Directory environment on my personal computer using VMware. The process of configuring and running this lab significantly deepened my understanding of Active Directory and Windows networking as a whole. This hands-on experience provided valuable insights into domain management, user authentication, and network communication, reinforcing key concepts in a practical way.</p>



<h2>Environments Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Microsoft Server 2019</b></li>
    <li><b>Windows 10</b></li>
    <li><b>VMware</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Program Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>Part 1 - Setting Up IP Addressing</h3>

<p>In this step, we first identify which adapter is connected to the internet (<code>INTERNET</code>) and which one is used for internal communication (<code>x_internal_x</code>). The adapter assigned a random IP address indicates an internal connection. We then assign a static IP address to the Internal NIC.</p>

<p>We rename the machine to <b>DC</b> (Domain Controller) to reflect its role in the network.</p>

<h3>Part 3 - Installing Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)</h3>

<p>After installing AD DS, I created my domain <b>mydomain.com</b> and set up a domain administrator password.</p>

<h3>Part 4 - Creating a Dedicated Domain Admin Account</h3>

<p>A successful ping confirms that the DNS server is operational. This verifies that the domain controller properly forwards requests to the internet and handles NAT correctly.</p>
